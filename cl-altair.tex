\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Worapol Boontanonda and currently, I am pursuing an MSc in High Performance Computing.
I will finish my dissertation at the end of August 2022 and should be able to start working from
September 2022 onwards. My graduation will be sometime around October but attending the graduation is not mandatory.
Before studying for the MSc I have worked as a Data Engineer for 3 years at Toyota Tsusho Nexty Electronics 
however, I have performed a lot of tasks that are unrelated to my role such as Fullstack Development 
and DevOps on the AWS Cloud. I believed my past experiences have proven me to be a person 
with a can-do attitude. Although I need to perform these unrelated tasks I still manage to do them successfully. 
Therefore, with this mindset, I can solve any engineering/software problem with the right tools. 
Unfortunately, having the correct mindset is not enough 
because having the correct skillset and expertise is also important. 
I hope that this MSc will help fill the missing piece in my skillset to progress my career further.

\lettersection{Why Altair}
I studied for this MSc because I wanted to learn more about scientific and high performance programming.
While studying I was exposed to different kinds of simulation problems such as percolation and N-body simulations.
Therefore, I would like to apply my knowledge more practically and learn more about scientific computing.
After, exploring Altair product lots of Altair product focuses on all sorts of scientific simulation for
the industry. I hope this job will be a new starting point for me in developing and optimising scientific
software and become a new open path for my career.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I think most of the skills listed in the job description matches both my past experiences and the MSc I am currently
studying. After graduating I think I will have all the necessary skills to perform this job. I want to combine
both my past industry experience in dealing with real production systems and new skills I am currently studying 
in optimising and developing applications to be as scalable as possible.
