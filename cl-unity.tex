\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Worapol Boontanonda and currently, I am pursuing an MSc in High Performance Computing.
I will finish my dissertation at the end of August 2022 and should be able to start working from
September 2022 onwards.
Before studying for the MSc I have worked as a Data Engineer for 3 years at Toyota Tsusho Nexty Electronics 
however, I have performed a lot of tasks that are unrelated to my role such as Fullstack Development 
and DevOps on the AWS Cloud. I believed my past experiences have proven me to be a person 
with a can-do attitude. Although I need to perform these unrelated tasks I still manage to do them successfully. 
Therefore, with this mindset, I can solve any engineering/software problem with the right tools. 
Unfortunately, having the correct mindset is not enough 
because having the correct skillset and expertise is also important. 
I hope that this MSc will help fill the missing piece in my skillset to progress my career further. I am currently studying how to optimise and write maintainable software.

\lettersection{Why Unity}
Unity is one of the most popular game engine use by indie, youtuber or professional game developers all around the world. Due to its ease of use and large free/paid game assets making awesome games with Unity become a lot easier. Developer can now focus time on the game mechanics rather than worry about the physic engine, networking and UI elements. I would like to be part of the team that contribute to this engine and help game developers around the world make their ideal game a reality.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I have used Unity before therefore when making decision I can input some real user perspective into the product itself. I have build lots of solutions on the cloud particularly on AWS. Therefore, I can use all of my experiences to apply best practices in building Unity backend services using appropriate cloud services. I have done both deployment and development on the cloud. I have done both unit testing and integration testing on the database by mocking data and cleaning up the database to make sure that the side effects are eliminated before starting the next test. From my old working experience I was exposed to Golang when I tried to implement a vehicle route problem solver as a REST API. Furthermore, as my own personal project I wrote a software to fetch cryptocurrencies prices via websocket.
