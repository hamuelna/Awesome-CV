\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Worapol Boontanonda and currently, I am pursuing an MSc in High Performance Computing.
I will finish my dissertation at the end of August 2022 and should be able to start working from
September 2022 onwards. My graduation will be sometime around October but attending the graduation is not mandatory.
Before studying for the MSc I have worked as a Data Engineer for 3 years at Toyota Tsusho Nexty Electronics 
however, I have performed a lot of tasks that are unrelated to my role such as Fullstack Development 
and DevOps on the AWS Cloud. I believed my past experiences have proven me to be a person 
with a can-do attitude. Although I need to perform these unrelated tasks I still manage to do them successfully. 
Therefore, with this mindset, I can solve any engineering/software problem with the right tools. 
Unfortunately, having the correct mindset is not enough 
because having the correct skillset and expertise is also important. 
I hope that this MSc will help fill the missing piece in my skillset to progress my career further.

\lettersection{Why Canonical?}
Ubuntu is one of the most used Linux distribution operating systems due to its ease of use. It will be an honour for me to work
on one of the most used Linux distros. I always wanted to join the open-source community unfortunately due to my
commitments on other projects while working in my old company. 
Contributing to open-source projects is nearly impossible due to the commitments for my commercial customers in my
old company. However, by joining Canonical I believed I will be allowed to freely contribute to the Ubuntu/Debian open-source community
and fulfil one of my dreams.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I think most of the skills listed in the job description matches both my past experiences and the MSc I am currently
studying. After graduating I think I will have all the necessary skills to perform this job. I want to combine
both my past industry experience in dealing with real production systems and new skills I am currently studying
in order to write well maintained software.
