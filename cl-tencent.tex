\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Worapol Boontanonda and currently, I am pursuing an MSc in High Performance Computing.
I will finish my dissertation at the end of August 2022 and should be able to start working from
September 2022 onwards. My graduation will be sometime around October but attending the graduation is not mandatory.
Before studying for the MSc I have worked as a Data Engineer for 3 years at Toyota Tsusho Nexty Electronics 
however, I have performed a lot of tasks that are unrelated to my role such as Fullstack Development 
and DevOps on the AWS Cloud. I believed my past experiences have proven me to be a person 
with a can-do attitude. Although I need to perform these unrelated tasks I still manage to do them successfully. 
Therefore, with this mindset, I can solve any engineering/software problem with the right tools. 
Unfortunately, having the correct mindset is not enough 
because having the correct skillset and expertise is also important. 
I hope that this MSc will help fill the missing piece in my skillset to progress my career further.

\lettersection{Why Tencent?}
Tencent is one of the leading technology companies from China and currently owns lots of products that are used
by many people such as JOOX and PUBG. 
It will be a privilege for me to work in a well-known
tech company to expand my horizons and get to learn more about what it takes to maintain these popular products. 
It was part of my dream to deal with real big data that requires
proper optimisation because the most company rarely get to deal with big data. This is because
the data is small enough that optimisation does not bring any value and benefit to the company. 
However, since Tencent products are very popular the amount of data is tremendous and proper optimisation do matter. 
I hope to fulfil my expected role as a data engineer to smoothen and speed up the data analysis in Tencent.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I think most of the skills listed in the job description matches both my past experiences and the MSc I am currently
studying. After graduating I think I will have all the necessary skills to perform this job. I want to combine
both my past industry experience in dealing with real production systems and new skills I am currently studying 
in optimising and parallelising applications to be as scalable as possible.
