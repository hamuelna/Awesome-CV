\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Worapol Boontanonda and currently, I am pursuing an MSc in High Performance Computing.
I will finish my dissertation at the end of August 2022 and should be able to start working from
September 2022 onwards.
Before studying for the MSc I have worked as a Data Engineer for 3 years at Toyota Tsusho Nexty Electronics 
however, I have performed a lot of tasks that are unrelated to my role such as Fullstack Development 
and DevOps on the AWS Cloud. I believed my past experiences have proven me to be a person 
with a can-do attitude. Although I need to perform these unrelated tasks I still manage to do them successfully. 
Therefore, with this mindset, I can solve any engineering/software problem with the right tools. 
Unfortunately, having the correct mindset is not enough 
because having the correct skillset and expertise is also important. 
I hope that this MSc will help fill the missing piece in my skillset to progress my career further. I am currently studying how to optimise and write maintainable software.

\lettersection{Why HashiCorp?}

HashiCorp is a pioneer in different tools and technologies that make development in the cloud easier and more maintainable. One of the biggest product from HashiCorp is Terraform one of the first infrastructure as a code (IaaC) framework used in many production systems around the world. I have also used Terraform to deploy a Kubernetes cluster to AWS EKS service. Terraform is more flexible than other solution because it can support deployment on many cloud services. I hope to be part of a team that will take the next step on making these technologies easier to use and requires less maintenance from the user.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I think I have enough skill and experience in both HashiCorp products such as Terraform and using the cloud. This is because I have at least 3 years of experience using AWS to develop application on the cloud environment, and I was exposed to lots of different cloud services. Furthermore, I have 2 AWS associate certification in order to ensure that I apply that best practices when I develop applications on the cloud. I have written some Golang application to solve a vehicle route optimization problem and expose it as a REST API service via AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda. I am hoping to apply some of my pain point when I was using Terraform to create a better product for HashiCorp.
